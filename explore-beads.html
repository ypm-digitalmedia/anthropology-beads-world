    <p>During  the week of 30 March, Gabriel Prieto a doctoral candidate from the Yale Anthropology  Department brought an assortment of beads from the Yale Peabody Museum to the  IPCH Digitization Lab for 3D scanning and reflectance transformation imaging.  The <a href="http://peabody.yale.edu/collections/anthropology/bead-collection">collection</a> donated by the Bead Society of Greater Washington includes intricately carved  ivory and large Murano glass beads from a still existent workshop in  Venice.  The aim of this digitization  project is to create Web-hosted visualizations of the beads for virtual  exhibition in a digital repository accessible by the public, as well as to  showcase the research and imaging facilities available to students and  researchers at Yale. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The  first method of digitization applied was 3D scanning. For this, the beads were securely  placed on a turntable in front of a triangulation laser scanner. The scanner  emits a series of beams that fall across the surface of the bead and detects  the location of thousands of points corresponding to the morphology of the  bead. Once points have been captured for the entire geometry of the bead, scans  can be aligned to one another to yield a digital likeness. Color information  was captured with the scanner as well. The 3D model can also be viewed without  any color texture in order to best visualize the geometry. </p>

    <p>The  second method of digitization was reflectance transformation imaging, a method  of capturing how the surface of an object interacts with light. A thin,  elongated carved ivory bead was chosen for this imaging method, due to the  complexity of the human and animal carvings on both sides. The bead was placed  underneath the RTI dome for imaging. This dome is equipped with 45 lights  placed along 4 different tiers at different known locations. A digital single  lens reflex camera at the top of the dome then captures one image for  individual projection of light. At the end of a three-minute acquisition, 45  images with different shadows and highlights have been captured. These images  may be post-processed to yield an interactive visualization file, where the  user may manipulate the direction of virtual light sources, to cast light along  the surface of the object. The raw data can also be processed to yield 3D  models with very detailed fine-grained geometry of the surface of the object  imaged.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Together  with the IPCH Digital Imaging Specialist, Gabriel scanned, imaged and  post-processed to yield final products. These 3D models and visualizations will  be incorporated into a Peabody website, not only to showcase the unique  specimens, but also to promote digital projects. The IPCH Digitization Lab is a  powerful resource at Yale, aimed at supporting digital documentation, research  and dissemination of the unique specimens of Yale's museum and galleries.</p>
