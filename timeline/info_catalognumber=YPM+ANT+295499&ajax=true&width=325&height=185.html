                    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Three black glass beads each with three sets of concentric circle decorations in white glass. In one case, the concentric circles protrude so that the center of the &#039;eye&#039; is furthest from the base of the bead. One bead is strung with a bronze suspension loop, and is said to be from Anatolia. This type of triangular eye beads date as early as the 9th century BCE, continuing into the 8th century BCE.; YPM ANT 295499</p>
