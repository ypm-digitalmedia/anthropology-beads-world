    <p>I  have had the pleasure of working with the bead collection since it arrived at  the Peabody Museum in 2009. I continue to guide the integration of all of the  donated beads into the Peabody&rsquo;s storage and cataloging systems. This project  has been challenging, interesting, and full of beauty.</p>
    <h2>Ongoing Integration</h2>
    <p>We began by migrating the data for the 1,116 beads that were  already in the Bead Society&rsquo;s Past Perfect database into the Peabody database,  KE EMu. Unfortunately that accounted for just over 45% of the donation. Next, we prioritized the systematic inventory  of the Timeline, starting with Panel A. Those beads that were not in the Past  Perfect database were given Peabody catalog numbers, as well as descriptions  which were based on the Timeline Exhibit Lectern Guide. The donor was  determined using the Bead Society Intake Book, and other attributes such as  size, material and original bead intake number were recorded. Additionally, it  is our goal to label each object with a Peabody catalog number, which is a  meticulous and time consuming task given the small size and large quantity of  the objects in this donation. Though many volunteer hours have been spent  affixing acid-free tags with catalog numbers to each of the beads, this effort  is ongoing. Also ongoing is our effort to capture high quality digital images  of all objects.</p>
    <p>A systematic inventory of the objects that were not in the  Past Perfect database which are in the General Collection has been started, but  much more work remains. Approximately 25% of the collection falls into this category.  With no Lectern Guide to base descriptions on, the process is more time  consuming. Many beads remain to be described, measured, photographed, and labeled  with their new catalog numbers. </p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>In an effort to make the collection more searchable and  usable to the research community, additional information regarding other  attributes must also be included. Currently some objects that are described as  beads functioned as spindle whorls, netsuke or cylinder seals. Therefore, after  we complete the cataloging of all the objects as described above we must return  to each object and add as many attributes as possible to the database such as  location of origin, time period, and function. This is a long-term objective  and will require much more research into individual objects.</p>
