    <p>In 1985 Richard Burger was carrying out investigations at  Chavin de Huantar, a site in the northern highlands of Peru famous for its  imposing temple and exquisite stone sculpture. Research showed that between 700-400 BC, the ceremonial core was surrounded  by one of the largest known settlements for this time period, a proto-urban residential area occupied by a  population of some 3,000 residents. Excavations on the steep slopes overlooking  the temple revealed deeply buried elite housing, In one unit, dubbed D1, a low  stone platform had been erected following the abandonment and filling of a  house and two offerings were recovered at the base and top of this  feature. Both consisted of a mixture of  guinea pig bone and spondylus shell fragments. The distinctively pink colored shell fragments were identified as  Spondylus princeps (sometimes known as the thorny oyster), a highly valued warm  water species alien to the cold waters of the shores of central and northern  Peru, but native to the warmer waters of  Ecuador and the far northern coast of Peru over 1,000 kilometers away.  The burial of guinea pigs with spondylus  shell is a traditional Andean religious offering which was still in use at the  time of the Spanish conquest.  In late  prehispanic times, spondylus, known as mullu, was considered a preferred food  of the gods.  Offerings placed in the  under the floors or in foundations of constructions were thought to ensure the  success of the building, an idea that remains common in some Peruvian highland  communities. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The spondylus shell encountered in the two offerings consisted  of 53 fragments including a dozen pieces that had been cut, polished and  perforated to form beads and small pendants. Almost 80% of the spondylus appears to be incomplete spondylus objects  that were cut but never finished or simply small scraps of spondylus that were  the residues of the shell working. Judging from these remains, the thorny oyster shells had been carried to  Chavin de Huantar in an unworked state and were then crafted into exotic shell  ornaments in the elite residential area behind the temple.  Yet the sacred power of the mullu was such  that even these unfinished spondylus fragments were considered as appropriate  as an offering to the Andean supernatural forces that governed daily life. </p>
